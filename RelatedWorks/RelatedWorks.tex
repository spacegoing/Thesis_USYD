\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Markov Random Fields}
\label{sec:MRF}
\emph{Markov Random Fields} are also known as \emph{undirected
  graphical model} can be seen as a regularized joint
log-probability distribution of arbitrary non-negative functions
over a set of maximal cliques of the
graph~\cite{bishop:2006:PRML}. Let $C$ denotes a maximal clique
in one graph and $\vy_C$ denotes the set of variables in that
clique. Then the joint distribution can be written as:
\begin{align}
  p(\vy)=\frac{1}{Z}\prod_{C}{\Psi_C(\vy_C)}
\end{align}
\noindent where $\Psi$ is called \emph{potential functions} which
can be defined as any non-negative functions and
$Z=\sum_{\vy}\prod_{C}{\Psi_C(\vy_C)}$ which is a normalization
constant. To infer labels which best explains input data set, we
can find the \emph{maximum a posteriori} (MAP) labels by solving
$\vy^*=\argmax_{\vy}p(\vy)$. Because potential functions are
restricted to be non-negative, it gives us more flexible
representations by taking exponential of those terms. Thus the
joint distribution becomes:
\begin{align}
  p(\vy)=\frac{1}{Z}exp(-\sum_{C}{E_C(\vy_C)})
\end{align}
\noindent where $E$ is called \emph{energy functions} which can be
arbitrary functions. Therefore, \emph{maximum a posteriori}
problem is equivalent to \emph{energy minimization} problem,
which is also known as \emph{inference}:
\begin{align}
  \vy^*=\argmax_{\vy}p(\vy)=\argmin_{\vy}(\sum_{C}{E_C(\vy_C)})
\end{align}
To optimize the performance we can also consider a weighted
version of energy functions. In order to do this we can decompose
energy functions over nodes $\gN$, edges $\gE$ and higher order
cliques $\gC$~\cite{Szummer:ECCV08} then add weights on them
accordingly. Let $\vw$ be the vector of parameters and $\phi$ be
arbitrary feature function, then the energy can be decomposed as
a set linear combinations of weights and feature vectors:

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:energyfunction_UPH}
  E(\vy;\vw)=\sum_{i\in \gN}{\vw_i^U\phi^U(\vy_i)}+
  \sum_{(i,j)\in \gE}{\vw_{ij}^P\phi^P(\vy_i,\vy_j)}+
  \sum_{\vy_C\in \gC}{\vw_C^H\phi^H(\vy_C)}
\end{align}

\noindent where $U$ denotes \emph{unary} terms, $P$ denotes
\emph{pairwise} terms and $H$ denotes \emph{higher order} terms
(when $|C|>2$ namely each clique contains more than two
variables).

A weight vector $\vw$ is more preferable if it gives the
ground-truth assignments $\vy_t$ less than or equal to energy
value than any other assignments $y$:

\begin{align}
E(y_t,w)\leq E(y,w)~ \text{,~}\forall y \neq y_t
\text{,~} y\in \sY
\end{align}


Thus the goal of \emph{learning} MRFs is to learn the parameter
vector $\vw^*$ which returns the lowest energy value for the
ground-truth labels $y_t$ relative to any other assignments
$y$~\cite{Szummer:ECCV08}:

\begin{align}
\vw^* = argmax_{\vw}(E(y_t,w)-E(y,w))~ \text{,~}\forall y \neq y_t
\text{,~} y\in \sY
\end{align}

We have introduced three main research topics of MRFs:
definition of \emph{energy function} (potential functions),
\emph{inference} problem (MAP or energy minimization) and
\emph{learning} problem. As for energy function, our work focus
on a class of higher-order potentials defined as a concave
piecewise linear function which is known as lower linear envelope
potentials over a clique of binary variables. It has been raising
much interest due to its capability of encoding consistency
constraints over large subsets of pixels in an
image~\cite{Kohli:CVPR07,Nowozin:2011}.

\citename{kohli2009robust} proposed a method to represent a class
of higher order potentials with lower (upper) linear envelope
potentials. By introducing auxiliary
variables~\cite{Kohli:CVPR10}, they reduced the linear
representation to a pairwise form and proposed an approximate
algorithm with standard linear programming methods. However, they
only show an exact inference algorithm on at most three terms.
Following their routine, \citename{gouldlearning} extended their
method to a weighted lower linear envelope with arbitrary many
terms which can be solved with an efficient algorithm. They
showed the energy function with auxiliary variables is submodular
by transforming it into a quadratic pseudo-Boolean
form~\cite{Boros:MATH02} and how
\emph{graph-cuts}~\cite{Hammer:1965, Boykov:ICCV01, Freedman:CVPR05} like
algorithm can be applied to do exact \emph{inference}.

\citename{gouldlearning} solved \emph{learning} problem of lower
linear envelope under the max margin
framework~\cite{tsochantaridis2005large}. In their work they
pointed out the potential relationship between their auxiliary
representation and latent SVM~\cite{yu2009learning}. Our work is
closely based on their research. We continue to use the higher
order energy function and inference algorithm developed in their
previous work~\cite{Gould:ICML2011} and extend their max margin
learning algorithm to include latent variables. The learning
algorithm we use is an extension of max margin framework which is
known as ``latent structural SVM''~\cite{yu2009learning}.

\subsection{Latent Structural SVMs}
\label{sec:latent-struct-svms}

The max-margin
framework~\cite{Taskar:ICML05,tsochantaridis2005large} is a
principled approach to learn the weights of pairwise MRFs.
\citename{Szummer:ECCV08} adapted this framework to optimize
parameters of pairwise MRFs inferred by graph-cuts method. In our
previous work \citename{gouldlearning} extended this framework
with additional linear constraints which enforces concavity on
weights thus can be used for learning lower linear envelope
potentials.

In this section we introduce \emph{latent structural
  SVM}~\cite{yu2009learning} which extends the max-margin
framework by encoding latent information in feature vector. In
section~\ref{sec:learning} we will show how this framework can be
adapted to learn parameters for higher order energy function with
latent variables.

Given an a linear combination of features vector $\phi(\vx ,\vy)
\in \sR^m$ and weights $\vtheta \in \sR^m$, and a set of
$n$ training examples $\{\vy_i\}_{i=1}^n$ max-margin framework
can be used to solve optimized solution $\vtheta^*$. To include
unobserved information in the model, Yu\cite{yu2009learning}
extended the joint feature function\cite{tsochantaridis2005large}
$\phi(\vx,\vy) $ with a latent variable
$\vh\in \mathcal{H}$ to
$\phi(\vx,\vy,\vh) $. So the inference
problem becomes
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:latent_ssvm_linearcomb}
  f_\theta(x) = \argmax_{(\vy \times \vh) \in \sY
  \times \sH} \vtheta\cdot\phi(\vx,\vy,\vh)
\end{align}

Accordingly, the loss function can be extended as

$$
\Delta((\vy_i,\vh^*_i(\theta)),(\hat{\vy}_i(\vtheta),\hat{\vh}_i(\vtheta)))
$$

\noindent where

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:latentssvm_full_inf}
 (\hat{\vy}_i(\vtheta),\hat{\vh}_i(\vtheta))=\argmax_{(\vy
  \times \vh) \in \mathcal{Y} \times \mathcal{H}}
\theta\cdot\phi(\vx_i,\vy,\vh)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:latentssvm_latent_inf}
  \vh^*_i(\theta) = \argmax_{\vh \in \mathcal{H}} \theta \cdot
  \phi(\vx_i,\vy_i,\vh)
\end{align}

The loss function under this formulation measures difference
between the inferred result pair $(\hat{\vy}_i(\theta),
\hat{\vh}_i(\theta))$ and the pair $(\vy_i(\theta),
\vh_i^*(\theta))$ which best explains the training data.
However, under this formulation the ``loss augmented inference''
used in structural SVMs\cite{tsochantaridis2005large} to remove
the complexity cannot be performed due to the dependence of loss
function $\Delta$ on hidden variables $\vh^*_i(\theta)$.
\citename{yu2009learning} argued that in real world applications
hidden variables are usually intermediate results and are not
required as an output\cite{yu2009learning}. Therefore, the loss
function can only focus on the inferenced hidden variables
$\hat{\vh}_i(\theta)$ which leads to:

$$
\Delta((\vy_i,\vh^*_i(\theta)),(\hat{\vy}_i(\theta),\hat{\vh}_i(\theta)))
=
\Delta(\vy_i,\hat{\vy}_i(\theta),\hat{\vh}_i(\theta))
$$

Thus the upper bound used in standard structural
SVMs\cite{tsochantaridis2005large} can be extended to:

\begin{align}
  \Delta((\vy_i,\vh^*_i(\theta)),(\hat{\vy}_i(\theta),\hat{\vh}_i(\theta)))
  &\leq \bigg(\max_{(\hat{\vy} \times \hat{\vh}) \in
    \mathcal{Y} \times \mathcal{H}}
    [\theta\cdot\Psi(\vx_i,\hat{\vy},\hat{\vh}) +
    \Delta(\vy_i,\hat{\vy},\hat{\vh})]\bigg)\\
  &-\max_{\vh \in \mathcal{H}} \theta \cdot
    \Psi(\vx_i,\vy_i,\vh)
\end{align}

Hence the optimization problem for Structural SVMs with latent
variables becomes

\begin{align}
\label{eq:latent_ssvm_object}
  \min_\theta\bigg(\frac{1}{2}\|\theta\|^2+
  C\sum_{i=1}^{n}\big(\max_{(\hat{\vy} \times
  \hat{\vh}) \in \mathcal{Y} \times \mathcal{H}}
  [\theta\cdot\Psi(\vx_i,\hat{\vy},\hat{\vh}) +
  \Delta(\vy_i,\hat{\vy},\hat{\vh})]\big)\bigg)\\
  -C\sum_{i=1}^{n}\big(\max_{\vh \in \mathcal{H}} \theta \cdot
  \Psi(\vx_i,\vy_i,\vh)\big)\nonumber
\end{align}

\noindent which is a difference of two convex functions. Problem
of this formulation can be solved using the Concave-Convex
Procedure (CCCP)\cite{yuille2002concave} which is guaranteed to
converge to a local minimum. \citename{yu2009learning} proposed a
two stages algorithm. In the first step the latent variable
$\vh_i^*$ which best explains training pair $(\vx_i, \vy_i)$ is
found by solving equation~\eqref{eq:latentssvm_latent_inf}. This
step is also called the ``latent variable completion'' problem.
In the second step $\vh_i^*$ is used as completely observed to
substitute $\vh$ in equation~\eqref{eq:latent_ssvm_object}.
Therefore, solving equation~\eqref{eq:latent_ssvm_object} is
equivalent to solve the standard structural SVM problem.

Auxiliary variables was introduced to help representing lower
linear envelope potentials in an energy-minimization
setting~\cite{Kohli:CVPR10}. In order to adapt the energy
function to max margin framework, \citename{Gould:ICML2011}
approximated the energy function using equally spaced
break-points thus removed those auxiliary variables. In this
thesis we try to optimize the energy function exactly by
introducing auxiliary variables back into the feature vector and
solving the learning problem using the latent structural SVM
framework. We will present this in detail in
section~\ref{sec:learning}.
