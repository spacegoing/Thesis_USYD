\section*{\hfil Acknowledgements \hfil}

Thank you to my supervisor Dacheng Tao for his invaluable and
unconditional supports for my research during all these years.
His great patience and willingness to give his time so generously
are very much appreciated. Thank you to my associate supervisor
Dongjin Song for keep motivating and encouraging me to explore
hard challenges. The Skill-Action architecture will not be
discovered without their supports. Thank you to Shangtong Zhang
for his great open source project. Thank you to Pierre-Luc Bacon,
Matthew D Riemer and Shangtong Zhang's patience in answering my
questions. I would also like to express my very great
appreciation to the open source community (Python, OpenCV and
Chun-Nam Yu etc.). I cannot finish this work without their
generous contributions.
